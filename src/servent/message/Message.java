 * This is your basic message. It should cover most needs.

 * 		<li>Message ID - unique on a single servent.</li>
 * 		<li>Message type</li>
 * 		<li>Info about the initial message sender</li>
 * 		<li>Receiver info</li>
 * 		<li>Route list (constructed via <code>makeMeASender</code> )</li>
 * 		<li>Arbitrary message text</li>
 * 		</ul>
 * 	<li>Is serializable</li>
 * 	<li>Is immutable</li>
 * 	<li>Modification methods:<ul>
 * 		<li>makeMeASender - adds the current servent to the route list</li>
 * 		<li>changeReceiver - changes the receiver info attribute</li>
 * 		<li>IMPORTANT: if your subclass adds an attribute that you need copied,

 * 		</ul>
 * 	<li>Equality and hashability based on message id and original sender id</li>
